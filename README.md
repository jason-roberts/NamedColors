#NamedColors

A collection of named colors with projections to various platforms for easy integration.

Currently a work in progress towards "version 1"

## Contributing Colors

* Please use Pascal case for color names

* Color values are RGB hex 6 character (no preceeding #), i.e. use 000000 rather than 000 for black

* By contributing you assert that color names are not trademarked or otherwise protected by law.

Thanks :)
